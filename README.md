# ***WeatherPy_Challenge***

## **Project Overview**

## *Background*

Beta testers input statements to filter data for weather preferences. These preferences will then be used to identify potential travel destinations, as welll as nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
